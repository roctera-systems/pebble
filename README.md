## 🎯 Mission

Pebble was born out of necessity at FIU SEDS (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) when we realized that existing team collaboration tools were simply too expensive for student organizations with limited budgets. Instead of compromising on functionality, we decided to build our own open-source solution that any student organization can use, modify, and contribute to.
